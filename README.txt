dayone-journal-py
=================

Day One (http://dayoneapp.com/) is a rather nice personal journal
application for iOS and Mac OS X.  While there is no official way to
access your journal from any other platform, it stores its data in
simple XML-formatted property lists in Dropbox.  (Or in iCloud, but if
you're using that presumably you have a Mac which you can run the real
Day One app on.)

This is a small library and tool to work with a Day One journal from
anywhere there is Python.  While it is currently simple and
featureless I plan to expand it to be more useful in the near future.

Developed on Python 2.7.3.  Requires Baker
(http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Baker) to run the command line utility.
